The Smart Araneta serves as a sought-after venue for both local and international concerts, basketball tournaments, boxing matches, religious assemblies, and various significant gatherings.

Among the more recent additions to Cubao's commercial landscape is Gateway Mall, inaugurated in 2007.

Being the most populous city in Metro Manila, it has a very diverse cultural and ethnic background, a robust and booming business district, and can be said to be the center point of the Philippine entertainment industry as it is home to the two major broadcasting stations in the Philippines, claiming the name Philippine's Hollywood. It is also near major thoroughfares, shopping centers and establishments. It is home to many pre-selling and ready for occupancy condominiums to compensate for the large population in the city.  With the city being as big as it is, there are many different spots in the city which are known or famous in different areas. One of the most known areas in Quezon City that is located in the city's South Triangle business district, and known for its undeniable business opportunities, exceptional dining experience, and fun nightlife is Tomas Morato. Aside from that, condominiums are also close to north avenue, Eastwood City, GMA Broadcasting Center, Quezon City Hall, Philippine Heart Center, and East Avenue Medical Center.   Quezon City offers top-noth entertainment spots like bars, clubs, discos, karaoke, and comedy bars along with almost unlimited dining options like in Tomas Morato.",https://www.lamudi.com.phhttps://www.lamudi.com.ph/projects/the-symphony-towers/furnished-corner-1-bedroom-with-glass-walls-at-sym-173471512882/
